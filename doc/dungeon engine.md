# Event handler

All the behavior in the Dungeons is described with **Events**. These Events are
handled by the **EventProcessor** class. Any new Event is appended to a 
*pendingEvents* Stack (last in, first out list) stored in the EventProcessor. 
Then, after an Event is processed, the EventProcessor will check its *pendingEvents*
and process any pending Events.

All Events have a **floor** attribute as a reference. They also have an **actor**
attribute, which may be *null*. This references a Pokémon and will consume that
Pokémon's turn if not *null*. Events also have a list of Messages that should
be displayed to the player as gameplay messages. Finally, Events have a
*processServer()* method. This method is called to process that Event.
It should apply any direct changes, and add resulting Events to the
*resultingEvents* list. This avoids code redundancy and allows complex
interactions.

# Event listening

Objects from the entire project may implement the *DungeonEventListener* interface.
If so and if implemented properly, these Objects will have a method called after and 
before an Event is processed. This allows for a multitude of complex mechanics. 
For now, only Abilities and Status Conditions implement this Interface, but more 
will be added if necessary. While in the *preProcess()* method, an event may be 
destroyed to prevent it from being processed by using its *consume()* method.

Events can also have **flags**. These should have no impact on the behavior but should
help comunication between other objects that manipulate Events (for example, to avoid
doing the same process multiple times on a single Event).

# Turn order

Due to movement speed affecting how many times a Pokémon may act in a turn,
each turn is divided into **subturns**. There are 4 subturns in each turn 
(equal to the maximum speedboost).

Each Pokémon has an **Actor** object. This object remembers whether the 
Pokémon has acted yet during the current subturn. If it doesn't, it gets
an opportunity if its speed matches it (see table below). If a nonleader 
Pokémon skips its turn, and another Pokémon of the same team acts after, 
that Pokémon gets another chance to act. This allows, for example, team
members to travel in a line properly.

| Speed | Subturn 0 | Subturn 1 | Subturn 2 | Subturn 3 |
| - | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0.5 |    |      |      | Once every 2 turns |
| 0 |      |      |      | Acts |
| 1 |      |      | Acts | Acts |
| 2 |      | Acts | Acts | Acts |
| 3 | Acts | Acts | Acts | Acts |

Actors are sorted by apparition. Whenever a Pokémon spawns, an Actor object is
created for it and placed at the end of the Actor list. Players are an exception
to this as they are placed at the start of the list, so that they play first.

At the end of each turn, each Pokémon also gets an opportunity to rotate. This
allows allies to face back the leader if needed. All events are also stored in a
**GameTurn** object, which is then added to a list stored in Dungeon.

# Pokémon AI

Each Pokémon has an **AI** object. This object is different for Allies, Enemies,
and *null* for leaders. This object has an **AIState** that is set changed whenever
necessary. The AIState then decides what action (Event) the Pokémon will choose.

# Multiplayer communication

Multiplayer is not yet supported in Dungeons. However, implementing it should be 
fairly straightforward.

Since all randomness is computed using a seed shared between all players, only
the events that are directly triggered by user input are necessary to be sent to
other players. We will call those **Player action events** (PAE).

An input counter could be implemented to avoid communication errors: it would be 
transferred with the PAE and checked by the server to avoid late senders, and
then checked by the other clients to avoid late receivers.

# Saving in a dungeon

Saving and quitting in a Dungeon works similarly to multiplayer communication. Since 
randomness uses a seed, only PAE need to be saved. When reloading, these events are 
processed in order and the Player can get back to the game.

However this feature will only be possible for singleplayer explorations, since you can't
force another player to quit.

# Event list

Here is a list of all Events. Will be updated with the game. Bold events are PAE. Italic events are Events that use the Pokémon's turn.
