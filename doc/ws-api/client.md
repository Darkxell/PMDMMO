### `CHATMESSAGE` **(DEPRECATED)**

| field          | type or value | required | about                           |
| -------------- | ------------- | :------: | ------------------------------- |
| `action`       | `chatmessage` | &check;  |                                 |
| `message`      | string        | &check;  | message content                 |
| `tag`          | string        |          | tag of the user sending message |
| `tagcolor`     | hex color     |          | color of sender's tag           |
| `messagecolor` | hex color     |          | color of message                |
| `sendercolor`  | hex color     |          | color of sender                 |

example:

```json
{
    "action": "chatmessage",
    "message":"Message content",
    "tag": "DEV",
    "tagcolor": "#333333",
    "messagecolor": "#333333",
    "sendercolor": "#333333"
}
```

This is the payload you should send to the server when you want to add a message
to the chat.

Note: this payload used to be adressed at the legacy chat endpoint. Chat
endpoint is no longer supported for various reasons including security ones.

### `SALTRESET`

| field    | type or value | about |
| -------- | ------------- | ----- |
| `action` | `saltreset`   |       |

example:

```json
{
    "action": "saltreset"
}
```

This payload must be sent by a client to get a salt in order to log in. The
server will generate a new random salt and send it back to the client. The
client must authentificate by salting his hashed password using the set salt.
Trying to authentificate without reseting the salt will not be taken into
account by the server.

### `CREATEACCOUNT`

| field       | type or value   | about                            |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `action`    | `createaccount` |                                  |
| `name`      | string          | username                         |
| `passhash`  | string          | hashed password                  |
| `deploykey` | string          | deploy key if required by server |

example:

```json
{
    "action": "createaccount",
    "name": "Darkxell",
    "passhash": "h4guz8eph5u",
    "deploykey": "value"
}
```

This payload must by a client to create a new account. This will create a new
account entry in the database. The account will not be created if the server is
in deploykey only mode and a valid key isn't provided. Note that if the server
doesn't need a key for account creation at the moment he recieves this payload,
the key won't be consumed, even if it is valid.

### `PUBLICKEYREQUEST`

| field    | type or value      | about |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| `action` | `publickeyrequest` |       |

example:

```json
{
    "action": "publickeyrequest"
}
```

This payload can be sent by the client to the server anytime. This will notify
the server that the client would like to know the server's public async
encryption key to setup a synchronous encryption communication.

### `SETENCRYPTIONKEY`

| field       | type or value      | about                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `action`    | `publickeyrequest` |                                            |
| `value`     | object             | hex string of sync key client wants to use |
| `value.key` | string             |                                            |

example:

```json
{
    "action": "setencryptionkey",
    "value": {
        "key":"-------------",
    }
}
```

This payload should be sent by any client who wants to use encryption. The
server will now return payloads encrypted with the parsed key, and will be able
to decrypt any message sync encrypted with it from the client who sent it.

This payload "value" field has to be the needed json payload above as string
encrypted asynchronously with the server public key. For more information, refer
to the [login documentation](./hashing%20norms.md)

### `LOGIN`

| `passhash` | string        | hashed password |

example:

```json
{
    "action": "login",
    "name": "Darkxell",
    "passhash":"h4guz8eph5u"
}
```

This payload must by a client to login. This must be sent with the appropriate
salted password, see hashing norms.

| `posfy`      | string (Double)    | y coordinates    |
| `posfy`      | string (int)       | pokémon ID       |

example:

```json
{
    "action": "freezoneposition",
    "freezoneid": "base",
    "posfx": "42.1337",
    "posfy": "42.1337",
    "currentpokemon": "1",
