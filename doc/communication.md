# CLIENT / SERVER communication protocol
Last updated may 17th (2018)

# 1 - General information

Communication between the game server and the clients is based around the Websocket protocol.
The websocket RFC is available here:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455

The server is divided in two parts, each having their own TCP socket endpoint: a chat and a game information endpoint.
It is the client's job to connect to both to send and be able to recieve the appropriate information.
The endpoints are available at the following adresses:

\[server ip or linked dns]:8080/PMDMMOServer/chat

\[server ip or linked dns]:8080/PMDMMOServer/game

# 2.1 - Required payload structure

The data sent to the server MUST be in a valid JSON structure, and encoded as text in the websocket container.
The server will ignore all binary payloads recieved (This is subject to change, refer to the latest documentation folder on github).

The server will not send a direct response to a client upon recieving a payload, but can be expected to send a receipt back for most informations.

The Json containing any payload must contain a String field called "action", wich is used to describe the content of the payload.
The other informations are payload dependant.

# 2.2 - Encryption

Any payload sent by a logged client to the server can be encrypted using AES256.
The encryption key used must be the key sent by the client to the server in the SETENCRYPTIONKEY payload
To use encrypted payloads, the client can just encrypt the JSON string as an encrypted string and send it in a clear text payload using the following structure:
{encrypted:1,value:"YOUR ENCRYPTED VALUE HERE"}

The server will encrypt any payload it sends to the client using the exact same fashion.

The only exeptions to this is is the SETENCRYPTIONKEY payload.
Refer to the specific documentation of this payload for further information.

For more informations about the login challenge, check "hashing norms.md".

# 3 - List of client -> server payloads

■ MESSAGE (This is a payload destined to the chat endpoint)

{"action":"message",

"tag":"DEV", // (Optionnal) The tag of the user sending the message 

"sender":"Darkxell", // The name of the sender

"message":"Message content", // the content of the message

"tagcolor":"#333333", // (Optionnal) The color of the sender's tag, in valid hexadecimal string

"messagecolor":"#333333", // (Optionnal) The color of the message, in valid hexadecimal string

"sendercolor":"#333333" // (Optionnal) The color of the sender, in valid hexadecimal string

}

This is the payload you should send to the server when you want to add a message to the chat.


■ SALTRESET

{"action":"saltreset"}

This payload must be sent by a client to get a salt in order to log in. The server will generate a new random salt and send it back to the client. The client must authentificate by salting his hashed password using the set salt.
Trying to authentificate without reseting the salt will not be taken into account by the server.

■ CREATEACCOUNT

{"action":"createaccount",

"name":"Darkxell", // The name of the player

"passhash":"h4guz8eph5u", // The hashed password

}

This payload must by a client to create a new account. This will create a new account entry in the database.

■ PUBLICKEYREQUEST

{"action":"publickeyrequest"}

This payload can be sent by the client to the server anytime. This will notify the server that the client would like to know the server's public async encryption key to setup a synchronous encryption communication. 

■ SETENCRYPTIONKEY

{"action":"setencryptionkey",

"value" : 
        #---------encrypted as hex string of bytes obtained by encrypting with the server public key--------
		{"key":"-------------", // Hexa string representation of the synchronous key the client wants to use from now on
		}
        #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
}

This payload should be sent by any client who wants to use encryption.
The server will now return payloads encrypted with the parsed key, and will be able to decrypt any message sync encrypted with it from the client who sent it.

■ LOGIN

{"action":"login",

"name":"Darkxell", // The name of the player

"passhash":"h4guz8eph5u", // The hashed password
