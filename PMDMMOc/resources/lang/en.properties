cutscene.base.magnetialert.m3=Anyways... <br> Today marks the start of our rescue team! Let's always do our best!
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m4=........
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m5=......................
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m6=... But, anyways... <br> We don't have any job offers yet... <br> Hahahaha...
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m7=Oh, yeah! <br> Maybe there's something in the mailbox...
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m8=<partner-name> checked the mailbox.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m9=The mailbox contained a <blue>Rescue Team Starter Set</color>!
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m10=I knew it'd be there! <br> It's the <blue>Rescue Team Starter Set</color>!
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m11=They always give you one if you start a rescue team.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m12=<partner-name> opened the <blue>Rescue Team Starter Set<blue>. <br> There was a <blue>Rescue team Badge</color> inside! <br> There was a <blue>Toolbox</color> inside! <br> There was also an issue of <blue>Pokemon News</color> inside!
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m13=Yes! <br> There are some good things here!
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m14=First off, the <blue>rescue team badge</color>. <br> It shows that we're a rescue team.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m15=This is a <blue>Toolbox</color>. <br> You use it for carrying items you find in dungeons. <br> Let's put the stuff Butterfree gave us in here for now. <br> Items are very useful, so let's use them on our adventures.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m16=And finally, a copy of the <blue>Pokemon news</color>. <br> It's useful for rescue teams. I'll leave it in the Mailbox. You should read it later on.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m17=Anything else? <br> Is there any other mail...? <br> Maybe not?
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m18=<partner-name> checked the Mailbox. <br> But the Mailbox was empty.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m19=Ok, so there isn't any mail for us after all...
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m21=If there were any rescue jobs, we could be getting mail, but... <br> Pelipper's office stopped delivering missions directly to rescue team's mailboxes long time ago, unless someone specifically needs our services...
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m22=Flap! Flap!
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m23=Clunk!
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m24=Oh? <br> I wonder what it could be.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m25=<player-name> checked the Mailbox.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m26=Maybe it's a rescue job offer! <br> What does it say?
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m27=<player-name> read the letter.
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m28="BZZ BZZ BZZ! <br> I HEARD ABOUT YOU FROM CATERPIE. PLEASE. WE NEED YOUR HELP. MAGNEMITE IS IN TROUBLE. <br> A STRANGE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE FLOWED THROUGH A DUNGEON... AND IT STUCK TOGETHER MAGNEMITE AND MAGNEMITE... <br> THAT ISN'T ENOUGH TO FORM A MAGNETON. IT'S NOT COMPLETE THE WAY IT IS NOW. <br> PLEASE. WE NEED HELP. BZZ BZZ BZZ. <br> <br> FROM MAGNEMITE'S FRIEND"
cutscene.base.magnetialert.m29=Let's do our best!
cutscene.base.magnetientrence=OH, YOU ARE HERE. <br> BZBZBZZ! <br> MY FRIENDS ARE IN THIS CAVERN. BZBZBZZ. <br> MY FRIENDS SHOULD BE ON BASEMENT 6. PLEASE HELP THEM! <br> BZBZBZZZT!
cutscene.magnetifound=Oh, there they are! <br>Let's get them out safely.
cutscene.magnetisave.m1=OUR BODIES SEPARATED. <br> BZBZBZZ. REJOICE! BZBZBZZT!
cutscene.magnetisave.m2=YAY! BZBZBZZT!
cutscene.magnetisave.m3=BE THANKFUL, YOU TWO.
cutscene.magnetisave.m4=YOU ARE OUR HERO. <br> THANK YOU. BZBZBZZ!
cutscene.magnetisave.m5=<player-name>'s team received the reward <blue>500</color> <poke1><poke2>.
cutscene.magnetisave.m6=The team also received the item <green>Reviver Seed</color>.
cutscene.magnetisave.m7=The team also received the item <green>Rawst berry</color>.
cutscene.base.magnetiend.m1=I'm glad our rescue mission went well today.
cutscene.base.magnetiend.m2=Actually, since this was our first job as a proper rescue team... <br> I was really tense and nervous. <br> I'm exhausted now. I've got to get some sleep. <br> Let's keep up our good work tomorrow. <br> See you.
cutscene.base.dream1.m1=......
cutscene.base.dream1.m2=.............
cutscene.base.dream1.m3=Where...
cutscene.base.dream1.m4=Where am I?
cutscene.base.dream1.m5=Maybe... Is this a dream...?
cutscene.base.dream1.m6=...Oh? There's someone here.
cutscene.base.dream1.m7=Who is it...? Someone I know...?
cutscene.base.dream1.m8=......Hmm... I can't remember.
cutscene.base.dream1.m9=.........
cutscene.boss.after_defeat.m1=We reached the end of the dungeon.
cutscene.boss.after_defeat.m2=There's nothing left here to do.
cutscene.boss.after_defeat.m3=Let's go home.
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m1=......
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m2=...Again? Am I dreaming again...?
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m3=...It's that Pokémon again.
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m4=Huh? <br>They're...talking to me...?
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m5=...I can't hear them clearly. <br>What are they saying?
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m6=Huh? It's shaking. An earthquake?
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m7=Whoa! It's getting worse.
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m8=For a dream, this feels strangely real, but...
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m9=......
cutscene.skarmory.dream.m10=.......................
cutscene.skarmory.request.m1=<speech>: Uhh<dots> Hello?
cutscene.skarmory.request.m2=<speech>: Hello? Uhh<dots> <br>You are <player-name><dots> Aren't you?
cutscene.skarmory.request.m3=<speech>: <dots>Oh! You can't see us, of course! <br>How very rude of us!
cutscene.skarmory.request.m4=<speech>: We're pleased to meet you. <br>We are Dugtrio.
cutscene.skarmory.request.m5=Last night, during the earthquake<dots>
cutscene.skarmory.request.m6=Our child Diglett was attacked<dots>
cutscene.skarmory.request.m7=He was whisked away to the peak of a tall mountain.
cutscene.skarmory.request.m8=We couldn't possibly climb somewhere so high up<dots>
cutscene.skarmory.request.m9=That is why we must call upon you for help, <player-name>.
cutscene.skarmory.request.m10=Diglett was abducted by a Pokémon named Skarmory.
cutscene.skarmory.request.m11=It's a vilely visious ruffian! <br>Please do be careful.
cutscene.skarmory.request.m12=Please, we need your help! <br>We must go!
cutscene.skarmory.request.m13=...........
cutscene.skarmory.request.m14=<dots>That was so sudden, there was no time to even say no<dots>
cutscene.skarmory.request.m15=It's too bad, I'd better go.
cutscene.skarmory.team.m1=Good morning, <player-name>!
cutscene.skarmory.team.m2=.........Huh?!
cutscene.skarmory.team.m3=You were just asked on a rescue mission?
cutscene.skarmory.team.m4=Yes!
cutscene.skarmory.team.m5=Our child, Diglett, was kidnapped! He was taken to <yellow>Mt. Steel</color>'s summit! <br> Please, we need your help! <br> Bye-bye!
cutscene.skarmory.team.m6=...Uh, OK... <br> Let's go...
cutscene.skarmory.enter.m1=Here we are... <yellow>Mt. Steel</color>...
cutscene.skarmory.enter.m2=So, Diglett was whisked to its peak...
cutscene.skarmory.enter.m3=<speech>: That's right!
cutscene.skarmory.enter.m4=The peak is 9F! Thank you for helping! Farewell!
cutscene.skarmory.enter.m5=...... <br> Uh, let's go.
cutscene.basesquareopen.m1=Good morning, <player-name>! <br> Aren't you up early?
cutscene.basesquareopen.m2=Oh! <br> Let's check the mailbox.
cutscene.basesquareopen.m3=Is there anything? Any rescue requests?
cutscene.basesquareopen.m4=Huh? empty?!
cutscene.basesquareopen.m5=Hmm... <br> I suppose so. <br> We've only started, after all.
cutscene.basesquareopen.m6=Well, too bad. <br> Want to go to Pokemon square? <br> I think if we go to the <blue>Pelipper Post Office</color>, there'll be jobs posted. <br> Pokemon Square's over this way. Let's go.
cutscene.squaretutorial.m1=This is Pokemon Square.
cutscene.squaretutorial.m2=That's the <blue>Keckleon Shop</color>. <br> You can buy and sell items here.
cutscene.squaretutorial.m3=That's the <blue>Felicity bank</color>. <br> You can save your money there.
cutscene.squaretutorial.m4=This is the <blue>Gulpin Link Shop</color>. <br> Gulpin can link moves for you. <br> Huh? What's linking? <br> Well, if you link moves... You can use them at the same time. <br> I think you should ask Gulpin if you want to know more.
cutscene.squaretutorial.m5=This is the <blue>Kangaskhan Storage</color>. <br> If you store items here, they'll never go missing. <br> You should store important items here before you go out on any dungeon adventure.
cutscene.squaretutorial.m6=What do you think? <br> The businesses here help us. <br> Oh, and there's also the <blue>Pelipper Post Office</color>. That's up past here. <br> I think we can get some information on rescue jobs. Let's first go to the <blue>Pelipper Post Office</color>.
cutscene.postskarmory.m1=Grr... I can't keep up! <br> I'll flee for now!
cutscene.postskarmory.m2=Hey there! <br> We chased Skarmory off! <br> It's ok now. <br> Come down over here.
cutscene.postskarmory.m3=I can't... I'm too scared to move...
cutscene.postskarmory.m4= Ok, no problem. <br> We'll come to you. Just wait.
cutscene.postskarmory.m5=...Whoa.
cutscene.postskarmory.m6=Sheesh! Look at this cliff... I can't see the bottom.
cutscene.postskarmory.m7=<player-name>, what'll we do? <br> We can't get across this.
cutscene.postskarmory.m8=<speech>: BZBZBZZ!
cutscene.postskarmory.m9=Oh, hi! <br> You're the magnemite we saved!
cutscene.postskarmory.m10=WE GOT WORD OF THIS. WE CAN RESCUE DIGLETT FROM THE SKY. BZBZBZZ!
cutscene.postskarmory.m11=HOLD ON TO US TIGHT. <br> BZBZBZZZ!
cutscene.postskarmory.m12=DON'T BE SCARED. WE WON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ZAPPING YOU. BZBZBZZT!
cutscene.postskarmory.m13=Ohhh... <br> I was very scared.
cutscene.postskarmory.m14=Maybe because I was somewhere up so high... <br> My feet feel like they're still walking on air...
cutscene.postskarmory.m15=(Feet?...)
cutscene.postskarmory.m16=(HE HAS THEM? FEET?)
cutscene.postskarmory.m17=Well, you're safe now. <br> That's what counts.
cutscene.postskarmory.m18=Yes. Thank you very much.
cutscene.postskarmory.m19=<speech>: Oh! You've been rescued! <br> Great! Great!
cutscene.postskarmory.m20=Huh? What was that? <br> Am I hearing voices?
cutscene.postskarmory.m22=...Whoops! You can't see us? That's terribly rude of us!
cutscene.postskarmory.m23=Hello. Dugtrio here.
cutscene.postskarmory.m24=Oh! Papa!
cutscene.postskarmory.m25=Diglett! You had us worried! <br> You're not hurt?
cutscene.postskarmory.m26=Nope! <br> It was scary, but I'm all right. <br> It's all thanks to Gobee's team.
cutscene.postskarmory.m27=Thank you for everything. <br> You're heroes.
cutscene.postskarmory.m28=You should be thanking our Magnemite friends. <br> This rescue was impossible to do on our own.
cutscene.postskarmory.m29=Oh, How rude of us! <br> Thank you so much!
cutscene.postskarmory.m30=NO, NO. <br> IT WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO. <br> AND... HOW BOTH OUR EVOLVED FORMS ARE JOINED TRIOS... I FELT A CERTAIN KINDSHIP. <br> AFTER ALL, POKEMON MUST HELP EACH OTHER.
cutscene.postskarmory.m31=I'm impressed. Sincerely, thank you.
cutscene.postskarmory.m32=We must be going. <br> <player-name>.
cutscene.postskarmory.m33=<partner-name>.
cutscene.postskarmory.m34=Thank you. <br> Farewell!
cutscene.postskarmory.m35=<player-name>'s team received the reward <blue>500</color> <poke1><poke2>.
cutscene.postskarmory.m36=The team also received the item <green>Pecha Scarf</color>.
cutscene.postskarmory.m37=The team also received the item <green>Ginseng</color>.
cutscene.postskarmory.m38=WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY TOO...
cutscene.postskarmory.m39=Oh, wait! <br> Don't go away!
cutscene.postskarmory.m40=WHAT IS IT?
cutscene.postskarmory.m41=Uh... <br> Would you like to join our team?
cutscene.postskarmory.m42=JOIN YOUR TEAM?
cutscene.postskarmory.m43=Yes. <br> We couldn't have done the last job if you weren't around, Magnemite. <br> I thought we would need more help for doing rescues in the future.
cutscene.postskarmory.m44=<player-name>, don't you think so too?
cutscene.postskarmory.c1=Yes! More members needed!
cutscene.postskarmory.c2=We don't need any help.
cutscene.postskarmory.m45=So, how about it? <br> Will you join us as members of our rescue team?
cutscene.postskarmory.m46=RESCUE TEAM... <br> THAT SOUNDS FUN! BZZ BZZ BZZ!
cutscene.postskarmory.m47=...BUT ...IF YOU NEED US TO RUSH OVER FOR RESCUES... <br> WE NEED SOMEWHERE TO LIVE CLOSE BY. <br> IS THERE ANYWHERE WE CAN LIVE IN THIS AREA?
cutscene.postskarmory.m48=...Ummm... well...
cutscene.postskarmory.m49=OH... <br> THERE ISN'T... <br> TOO BAD. SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T JOIN YOU. SEE YOU! BZZ BZZ BZZ!
cutscene.postskarmory.m50=That is too bad.
cutscene.postskarmory.m51=It looks like we need to find places for Pokemon to live if we want some to join our rescue team...
cutscene.postskarmory.m52=I know! <br> Let's go to pokemon square tomorrow. <br> There's an interesting place called the <blue>Wigglytuff Club</color>. <br> It wasn't open the other day when we went to the square. <br>It should be open tomorrow, though. It's next door to <blue>Felicity Bank</color>. <yellow>Wigglytuff</color> is usually there every day. We might be able to find some information. <br> OK, that's what we'll do tomorrow. We'll go to Pokemon Square.
