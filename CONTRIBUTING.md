## Issue reporting

Please do not open issues to ask questions about the game. In need of an answer
from a developer, please contact us via Discord.

Please avoid reporting known issues. If it has already been reported and the
issue is still open, please post in the existing thread instead of opening a
new one.

To make it easier for us to solve the different issues, you are expected to
follow our issue template if applicable.

Here are some good guidelines:

- **Include as many details as possible.**
  
  If you are reporting a bug, a good report should allow us to narrow the source
  of the bug to fix it quickly.

  Good ways to do so is to post the actions required to reproduce the bug, what
  you were doing at the time, and post log reports.

  If the bug isn't reliably triggerable, please specify at wich rate it occurs
  and what you could be doing when it triggers, even if it seems unrelated.
- **State the expected behavior,** as it might be an unclear UI issue.
- **Include screenshots if possible.**
- If the problem is performance related (high cpu/memory usage), **please
  include usage reports and a clear description of what you expected.**
- **Use a descriptive and short title that describes the issue well.** If it's a
  bug, include [BUG] in the issue title.

## Feature pull request

Pulling your contribution to this repository is unlikely without prior
discussion with us. You are free to fork the project and work on your own
mods/resource packs/whatever, but we will be the only juge when it comes to
merging your work.

We can only heavily encourage you to contact us via discord to discuss your
vision of the game and the ideas you might have to improve it before starting
working on them. If you would like to contribute regularly to the development of
the project, we can add you as a developer and give you push permissions to this
github repository.

As always, we are available on Discord.

## Feature discussion

Important non gameplay related feature requests should be treated as Issues and
therefore should follow the issue posting guidelines.

For anything related to the game itself, we will welcome any of your ideas and
are available on Discord. We encourage you to come talk with us and the
community about any ideas you might have.

Thanks for reading and contributing to the project!
