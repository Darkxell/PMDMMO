## Issue reporting

Please do not open issues on Github to ask questions about the game. Please
contact us via [Discord]. We don't bite!

Please avoid reporting known issues. If it has already been reported and the
issue is still open, please post in an existing thread instead of opening a
new one.

To make it easier for us to solve the different issues, please follow our issue
template if applicable:

- **Include as many details as possible.**
  
  If you are reporting a bug, a good report should allow us to narrow the source
  of the bug to fix it quickly.

  To better identify the source of your issue, please post the actions required
  to reproduce the bug, what you were doing at the time, and post relevant
  log reports (e.g. stack traces, diagnostics).

  If the bug isn't reliably triggerable, please specify at wich rate it occurs
  and what you could be doing when it triggers, even if it seems unrelated.
- **State the expected behavior,** as it might be an unclear UI issue.
- **Include screenshots of visible effects if possible.**
- **Please include relevant performance and memory usage metrics** if your issue
  is related to resource usage.
- **Use a descriptive and short title that describes the issue well.**

  e.g. If it's a bug, include [BUG] in the issue title.

## Feature pull request

While we encourage you to fork this project, we ask that if you plan on creating
a feature, you discuss it with us beforehand to better coordinate our resources.

If you would like to contribute regularly to the development of the project, we
can add you as a developer and give you push permissions to this github
repository.

As always, we are available on [Discord].

## Feature discussion

Important non-gameplay related feature requests should be treated as Issues and
therefore should follow the issue posting guidelines.

For anything related to the game itself, we will welcome any of your ideas and
are available on our Discord. We encourage you to come talk with us and the
community about any ideas you might have.

Thanks for reading and contributing to the project!
